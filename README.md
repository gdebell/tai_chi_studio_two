## What is Tai Chi Studio Two?

### Tai Chi Studio Two is a website designed for a small business to manage classes, instructors, and students at a Tai Chi Studio.  The site was designed and developed by 4 Galvanize students. The site has three different types of users; visitor, student, and manager.

### Visitor: A user is able to view classes at the studio, view instructors at the studio, read reviews about instructors, view the About Us page, view the Contact page, and sign up for a student account.

### Student: A student can do everything a visitor can do with some additional features.  A student is able to sign up for a class, write a review for an instructor, and sign in/out to their account.  A student can also view their account by clicking on their name once logged in at the top of the page.

### Manager: A manager can do everything the student can do with some additional features. A manager is able to edit a class, delete a class, and remove a student from a class.  A manager can also add, edit, and delete an instructor.
